# SWMP_Trends
Data and code to reproduce the statistical analyses in "20-year water quality analysis reveals spatial variability and long-term changes at North Carolinaâ€™s Masonboro Island National Estuarine Research Reserve". 

Included in this repository are the long-term NERR SWMP datasets and code needed for reproducing the statistical analyses and figures from the journal article above. The analyses were computed in R Studio and here you can find the specific code for preprocessing the datasets prior to statistical analysis, as well as the code for each of the stastical analyses used in this paper. For more information on the data preprocessing techniques and statistical analyses please see read the methodology section of the above paper.
