# SWMP_Trends
Data and code to reproduce the statistical analyses in "20-year water quality analysis reveals spatial variability and long-term changes at North Carolinaâ€™s Masonboro Island National Estuarine Research Reserve". 


## Overview
This repository includes the R code scripts used for preprocessing data and performing the statistical analyses in the study mentioned above. Brief descriptions of the R Scripts are outlined in the 'Script' section below. For more detailed information on the datasets and methodologies used, please see the study mentioned above.  


## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts in this repository, R Studio and the necessary R packages need to be installed. 

**Software**: R Studio (code was executed on R Studio Desktop 2020)

**R Packages**: see scripts below

**NERRS SWMP Data**: http://nerrscdmo.org/


## Scripts
Below are the R script names and the corresponding descriptions that can be used to replicate the data preprocessing and statistical analyses. Scripts can be found in the 'scripts' folder. 

**data_preprocessing.R**: Preprocessing SWMP data for statistical analyses. 

**data_normality_test.R**: Test normality (Shapiro Wilk test) and log-transform SWMP data prior to statistical analyses. 

**linear_regression.R**: Linear regression analysis to determine statistical significance and direction of trends over time. 

**anova.R**: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test and Tukey test. Tested spatial differences between three or more SWMP stations. 

**t_tests.R**: Student's t-test (normal data) and Welch's t-test (non-normal data). Tested spatial differences between two SWMP stations. 

**pca.R**: Principal component analysis (PCA) used to visualize relationships of all datasets.

**correlation_matrix.R**: Correlation matrix and significance test between variables for each SWMP station. 

**stl.R**: Seasonal-trend Decomposition of Time Series by Loess.
